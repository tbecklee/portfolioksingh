      <h4>My Dance School</h4>
      I designed this website to advertise my dance school. My goal has always been to start my own company teaching students and watching them grow. The first thing I did was design a website using WIX. The process was a little rough at times. One of the challenging parts was picking a design appealing to customers. Additionally, picking a name that is professional and has a ring to it. I created this website to advertise my company, so I had to make sure it was professional and interactive.

      <h4>The Dora Story</h4>
      I designed this interactive story and game as a part of my Computer Science Class. In this project my partner and my goal was to create a user interactive story. A game or story in which the users can affect the outcome of the story. In this project I created code on Scratch to create a storyline. Because there was a storyline we needed to make sure grammar was perfect.
