      <p>Hi everyone! Thank you for taking time out of your day to check out my website! I am a passionate student, dancer, and I grew up in Dublin, California!
      <br>
      <br>
      Having to juggle two jobs might be hard, however, regardless of the hardships, this is the path I hope to take in the future. Dancing is my passion, and I hope to keep it that way. As a second career, I hope to go down the path of law. One of my strongest traits, is that I am straight forward and fight for what I want. Thus, the field of law interests me. Along with being a lawyer, I hope to have my own dance school. I want to be able to watch kids grow day by day. Dance is a way to express yourself and spread positivity. I want to give kids that are passionate about dance a different persepctive to it. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Some qualities I have is that I am persistent and creative. When it comes to fighting arguments, I do not stop until I prove my point. This is the quality of a lawyer. A lawyer does not step back on their case unless their client is proven innocent. This trait also plays a role in the job of a dancer. I have to push through certain obstacles and keep on dancing. Creativity is also a key trait for a dancer. We make innovative choreography to perform or teach to others. 
      <br>
      <br>
      One of my biggest accomplishments from high school was getting on to the Dublin High team. The intense 3 to 4 hours spent every day revising the choreography to audition was not easy. However, it was all worth it because being on this team has brought positivity and optimism into my life. It has made me a more confident person. I have people to support me and keep me happy. 
      <br>
      <br>
      To tie it up, let me give you the words I live by; There is nothing you can not do, so keep pushing through, it is all going to be worth it someday!</p>

    <!-- This footer is similar to the header. I created a container and then a jumbotron to duplicate the one at the top. However, now the difference is that there are small icons at the bottom. The Dublin one goes to the Dublin High School website. The images were uploaded to my Images folder. I also changed the color to match the header. -->
